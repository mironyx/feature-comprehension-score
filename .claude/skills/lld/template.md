# LLD Template

The LLD is structured in two parts. **Part A** is for human review — a reviewer can read
Part A alone and build sufficient theory about the feature. **Part B** is for the implementing
agent — detailed enough for `/feature` to produce correct code autonomously.

One file per phase (phase mode) or one file per task (epic mode). Each implementation plan
section becomes a top-level heading.

# Part A — Human-Reviewable Design

> Both the human reviewer and the implementing agent read this part.
> For the reviewer, it builds theory about the feature. For the agent, it provides
> the conceptual foundation that Part B's details depend on.
> It answers: what does the feature do, how do the parts interact,
> what must always be true, and how do we know it works.

## N.1 [Section Name]

**Stories:** [story numbers]
**Layers:** DB | BE | FE

### Purpose
[1-3 sentences: what this section delivers and why]

### Behavioural Flows

Sequence diagrams for every non-trivial interaction (>2 components communicating).
Use mermaid `sequenceDiagram` syntax. One diagram per key flow (happy path, error path,
async/webhook flows as needed).

` ` `mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Route
    participant Service
    participant DB as Database

    Client->>API: POST /api/example
    API->>Service: processRequest(ctx, params)
    Service->>DB: query(...)
    DB-->>Service: rows
    Service-->>API: Result
    API-->>Client: 200 OK
` ` `

**When required:** Any flow involving >2 components or services. API routes with
auth + service + DB. Webhook handling chains. Multi-step UI interactions with server calls.

**When optional:** Single-component CRUD. Pure utility functions. Schema-only changes.

### Structural Overview

Module/class dependency diagram showing how the pieces fit together. Use mermaid
`classDiagram` syntax. Works for both class-based and module-based codebases:

- **Classes** — show with methods and relationships (inheritance, composition)
- **Modules** — use `<<module>>` stereotype, show exported functions
- **Interfaces/Ports** — use `<<interface>>`, show who implements them
- **Direction** — arrows show dependency direction (who depends on whom)

` ` `mermaid
classDiagram
    class engine/scoring {
        <<module>>
        +calculateScore(responses) Score
        +buildDimensions(config) Dimension[]
    }
    class ports/github {
        <<interface>>
        +fetchPRs(org, repo) PR[]
    }
    class adapters/github {
        <<module>>
        +createGitHubClient(token) GitHubPort
    }
    engine/scoring --> ports/github : depends on
    adapters/github ..|> ports/github : implements
` ` `

**When required:** Any task that introduces new modules/classes, modifies module boundaries,
or adds new dependencies between existing modules. Changes touching the ports/adapters layer.

**When optional:** Changes within a single existing module that do not alter its public
surface or dependencies.

### Invariants

Hard constraints that the implementation must satisfy. Collected in one place so the
reviewer can sign off on them and automated tools (`/pr-review-v2`, `/feature-evaluator`)
can verify them.

Each invariant should be testable — either by a unit test, a type check, or a lint rule.

| # | Invariant | Verification |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | [e.g. Service never calls createClient() directly] | [e.g. grep for import; unit test with mock ApiContext] |
| 2 | [e.g. Webhook replay is idempotent — no duplicate rows] | [e.g. test calls handler twice, asserts row count unchanged] |
| 3 | [e.g. Engine module has zero framework imports] | [e.g. grep src/lib/engine/ for 'next', 'supabase'] |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Concrete, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]

### BDD Specs

` ` `ts
describe('[context]', () => {
  it('[behaviour — given/when/then]');
  it('[another behaviour]');
});
` ` `

### HLD coverage assessment
- [Section X.Y] — sufficient, referenced only
- [Section X.Z] — needs extension, detailed below

# Part B — Agent Implementation Detail

> The implementing agent (`/feature`) reads both parts — Part A for the conceptual
> model, Part B for precise file paths, types, function signatures, and decomposition
> rules. A human reviewer may scan Part B for completeness but does not need to
> review it line-by-line.

## N.1 [Section Name] — Implementation

### [Layer: Database] (if applicable)

See [v<N>-design.md §N.N](v<N>-design.md#section-anchor) for [schema/RLS/functions].

[Only what the HLD doesn't cover: migration file strategy, seed data, test isolation, etc.]

### [Layer: Backend] (if applicable)

See [v<N>-design.md §N.N](v<N>-design.md#section-anchor) for [contracts].

#### File structure
` ` `
src/lib/module/
  file.ts          — [purpose]
  file.test.ts     — [what it tests]
` ` `

#### Internal types
[Types not in the public L4 contract but needed for implementation]

> **Constraint:** For any type referencing a DB column, grep `src/types/database.types.ts` to confirm the contract type matches the Supabase-inferred enum or union. Mismatches cause `as unknown as` casts at the call site — fix the type here in the LLD, not downstream in the implementation.

#### Function signatures
[Key internal functions with their signatures and behaviour]

#### Internal decomposition — [route or component]

For every non-trivial API route or component, add an explicit internal decomposition section
**before implementation begins**. Name every function, class, or interface that will exist
internally and state what is forbidden.

```
Controller (stays in route.ts, ≤ 5 lines):
- const ctx = await createApiContext(request)   // per-request composition root: assembles all clients
- return json(await service.fn(ctx, params))    // injects context into service

Service ([endpoint]/service.ts):
- Exported: `serviceFn(ctx: ApiContext, params: ParamType): Promise<ResponseType>` — [one-line purpose]
- Receives ApiContext (DI) — never calls createClient() or any infrastructure factory

  Private helpers (≤ 20 lines each):
  - `helperName(params): ReturnType` — [purpose and error behaviour]

Extracted to helpers.ts (if applicable):
- `pureFunction(...)` — [why extracted: testability, reuse]
```

Use `> **Constraint:**` for notes written **before** implementation (hard limits for the implementing
agent). Use `> **Implementation note (issue #N):**` only to document decisions made **after**
implementation — these are historical records, not pre-implementation guidance.

#### Error handling
[Error cases, codes, and recovery strategies]

### [Layer: Frontend] (if applicable)

See [v<N>-design.md §N.N](v<N>-design.md#section-anchor) for [contracts].

#### Component tree
` ` `
PageComponent
  ├── SubComponent
  │   └── ChildComponent
  └── AnotherComponent
` ` `

> **Constraint (server components):** Use module-level render helper functions rather than JSX sub-components inside server component files. Sub-components defined in the same file are opaque to test traversal — `render()` returns a serialised tree, so `screen.getByRole` cannot cross a sub-component boundary. Module-level helpers keep assertions traversable without extra wrapper renders.

#### Page routes
| Route | Component | Data fetching | Auth |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------|

#### UI states
| State | Trigger | Display |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Loading | Initial fetch | Skeleton |
| Error | API failure | Error message + retry |
| Empty | No data | Empty state message |
| Success | Data loaded | Content |

#### Client state
[What state lives on the client, how it's managed]
